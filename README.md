<p>This application is run on the local server 3001 of the users machine. When the server is started it sets up a connection to the mysql database and from there the user can seed the given data. They may then use a database manager like insomnia to view or alter various parts of the database using different routes. They can add, delete, or view categories of products, a product itself, or a tag on a product.</p>
